# Traffic-Sign-and-Signal-Classification-using-YOLOv5
In this file we (me and my teammates) use YOLOv5 repository to classify Traffic Signals and Traffic signs.
Also, a program to detect lanes was created by me alone.
I developed the code to classify and detect leanes, but the app to integrate it all was created by my other teammates.
